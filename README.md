## Metalist
There are tons of on-line resources for neuroimaging data analysis so the following list is not meant to be exhaustive. There are also similar lists here and there that might partly overlap with this one, so here is a list of lists.


### Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse
The most obvious place where everything is centralized is the [Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse](https://www.nitrc.org/). Many tools, atlases, courses are there but if your favorite isn't make sure to add it.


### Lab guides and lab wikis
If your lab does not have a lab guide/wiki, it is well worth the time to make one. Lab wikis can save a lot of time for newcomers to get set up and started (rather than reinvent the wheel or take time from other lab members), while lab guides will also help PIs, PhD students and post-docs know what to expect from each others and to promote a [healthier lab culture](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05142-9). [Mariam Aly](https://twitter.com/mariam_s_aly) explains that well [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06167-w).
